# Hi there, I'm Max! 👋

**B.Sc. Honors Computer Science • Minor in Statistics @ McGill University**

Driven by a passion for Artificial Intelligence, I am a final-year Honors Computer Science student at McGill. I combine a strong statistical foundation with hands-on experience in Deep Learning and NLP, having built poker bots, CNNs, and enterprise AI tools. I aim to leverage advanced ML techniques to solve complex, real-world problems.
